# Chapter 7: Align and Connect for Teamwork



| If all objectives are cascaded causes 4 adverse effects: |
| -------------------------------------------------------- |
| A loss of agility                                        |
| A lack of flexibility                                    |
| Marginalize contributors                                 |
| One-dimensional linkages                                 |

Instead we may use market-based approach, high level OKRs are shared and the others (by team level) is transparent to everyone and with dependencies

The mix of top-down and bottom up goals generally settles at around half-and-half
