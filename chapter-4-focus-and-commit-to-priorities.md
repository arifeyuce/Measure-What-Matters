| Note: An OKR needs a quality continuum for itself, specify the result in details as much as possible! |
| OKRs are neither a catch-all wish list nor the sum of teams mundane tasks                             |
| The key results should be paired for quality & quantity                                               |
| All team OKRs should link to the larger purpose we are expected to deliver around                     |
